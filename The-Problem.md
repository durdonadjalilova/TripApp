# Detailing the Problem to Fix

Buying and selling used cars has been a hassle since cars are a common necessity. 

**Shopping for used cars:**
The way people typically go about used-car shopping is either going to their local dealership and paying a higher price than if going directly to the seller, or they go to an online auction where they are met with a steep learning curve and are generally deterred from the process quite quickly. 

**Selling used cars:**
There are a couple very simple ways of selling your used car. Those include going to [Carmax](https://www.carmax.com/) and getting a quote that is valid for only a handful of business days, and is typically a significantly lower price than [Kelly Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com/) shows, or putting up a for-sale sign on your car, and getting bids from random strangers. 
 
**Conclusion:**
The process of buying or selling used cars is outdated, and there is no solution that general people are happy with.
